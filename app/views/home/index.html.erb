         For the better part of a generation, Australians have been subjected to a corporate dupoly that controls 80% of the food supply market share, not letting attributes such as quality, diversity and taste become selective pressures, but rather the directors of coles and woolworths and who is able to work with these large corporations.
As a result we have focused on profit rather than soil health, consistency rather than diveristy, asthetics rather than nutrient density. Therefore an entire generation of Australians (and westerners around the world) have fallen victim the modern American factory farming style which have wreaked havoc on their collective health. 
Now new technologies and communication methods, have put the power back in the hands of consumers and producers. We can now work together and take our health back into our own hands, by the formation of decentilised networks for cooperative food production!
Do you want better quality produce and support local growers? Do you have land and little resource, but would like to contribute? Are you time rich and resource poor? All of you can help! 
Join the revolution now...

## R7 	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

For over a decade now, the Australia's Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector has been in the grip of an ever-strengthening monopoly.
The two leading supermarkets in Australia today both started in the year 1914. 
- *Coles*, was merged with *Myer Emporium Ltd* in 1985, then becoming known as Coles Myer.
Today Coles has over 100,000 employees and, together with "rival" Woolworths, accounts for more than 80 per cent of the Australian market.
- *Woolworths*, owned by *Westfarmers* was originally a cooperative company created by an association of farmers from Western Australia known as the "Western Australian Farmers Federation"
    - They would distribute wheat, british oil, lifestock and by 1919 it had 64 other cooperative companies under its wing. 
    - They started the beginnings of the ABC and the Australian National Party. 

On 2 July 2007, Coles Group Limited (Coles) and Wesfarmers Limited (Wesfarmers) announced a proposal for Wesfarmers to acquire Coles. This was implemented on 23 November 2007 purchising Coles for $19.3 billion, the biggest corporate takeover in Australia's history.

This means that 80% of the food distribution in Australia comes under the roof of one company, a company which also owns Bunnings, Kmart, Target, Officeworks, Dan Murpheys among many others...
This kind of monopoly on virtually all the major industries have created an impalance of power which allows Westfarmers to bankrupt smaller brands and companies by lowering their prices. 
Rather than reducing operating costs to fund the lower prices, such as stocking pallets on the floor like Aldi, Coles and Woolworth have focused on reducing the price they pay for goods. 
This means the farmers that was once helped by this association is now able to demand whatever low prices they want, and farmers that want to stay in the business are forced to sell at that price.


## R8 	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

1. **Centralisation of Power & Resources**
*"Power Corrupts, Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"*
Apart from the obvious reasons why its a bad idea to consolidate power that way...lets talk about the Centralised distribution networks. 
Australia is a country inundated with all kinds of natural disasters, from bush fires to tsunamis to cyclones and floods, there are many ways that the distribution network can be disrupted.
Coronavirus is just the latest of these incidents that could very well get out of control and possibly create a state food insecurity in great regions across Australia (and the world).  
Its not unheard of that Australian residents have spent two weeks without power after a cyclone, or that trucks can't pass through certain areas after a flood. 
Currently the Australian government advises people to keep "reasonable stocks" of non-perishable foods so that in the event of a disaster, people wont starve. 
That means the responsibility for food security is not really in the hands of our government, it is supposed to be in the hands of the people. 
But today, we have a single point of failure in 80% of the food supply in Australia, a single point of failure called Westfarmers and our oil reserves. 
If Australia was unable to import oil from tomorrow onwards, we would run out of petrol within a couple of weeks. 
This is why it is imperitive that the people find ways of creating their own food security by growing locally and decentralising food distribution. 

2. **Pesticides Monocultres and the Agrochemical Farming Model**
- *Profit Driven Farming*
Since the end of the Vietnam war, chemical manufacturers that used to make chemcicals for war rebranded to make chemicals for agriculture. 
Pesticides such as the herbicide Roundup allowed increased profits for farmers in the west where labour costs are very high. They are now able to just spray their fields instead of weeding them. But alas, the weeds became resistant to the active ingredient called Glyphosate.
The solution came in the form of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) that were made to be resistant to Glyphosate, aka, "Roundup Ready" 
This caused unprecidented spikes in the amount of pesticides sprayed directly on food, rapidly causing accumulations in the environment, and in our bodies.
In order to use machines at large scales the western agricultural model have employed very few seed varieties and planting them in monocultures so that they can be harvested en masse. 

- *Results*
The result of this style of farming, which is unprecedented in the history of human civilisation, starts in the soils. 
First because we dont rotate crops enough and the fields lack diversity, the soils become depleted in certain essential nutrients, which ends up growing weak plants that are more susceptible to pests. 

Weeds start to grow, so we spray compounds like glyphosate on it, which, before it was marketed as a herbicide was actually discovered to be an antibiotic. The same shikimate pathway that it uses to kill plants also kills bacteria, the powerhouse of the soils. This causes further degradation of the soils, growing even weaker and less nourished plants. 

In order to cater for the vast distances that the food then needs to travel to make it to the supermarket shelves we harvest them weeks too early, before they have had a chance to attain their full nutrient load. 
End the end, we end up with foods that lack essential minerals like magnesium, lack nutrients and lack taste.  

3. **Economical Monopoly on Food Distribution**
Not only does this breed corruption through the imbalance of power, but it also results in an overall loss of profit to the producers and opportunities to the Australian processors and distributors. 
Shop owners and Australian brands find it impossible to co-exist with massive conglomorates like westfarmers, leading thhem to sell out or die out.
